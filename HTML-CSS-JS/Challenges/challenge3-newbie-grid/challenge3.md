## Overview

### The challenge

[Single price grid component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc) is a challenge that helps users practice Responsive Design for desktop & mobile versions.

## My process


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS display & position
- Attempting without Flexbox or Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to deploy with GitHub Pages to show my solution or ask for help in Frontend Mentor. I've deployed beforehand with Siteground, Heroku, and Google App Engine and this method was the easiest by far.

I learned a quirky aspect of old CSS. Apparently for inline-block elements, if the property is given to 2 different divs and it doesn't align next to each other, it's due to an HTML file problem. In HTML, the 1st closing div tag and the 2nd open  div tag must be next to each other in 1 line. Basically deleting the white space (enter) between them. Who knew?

I attempted to complete some steps based on the knowledge I know. Once I was satisfied, I would then watch a bit of his process to understand his thinking and see if there was a better approach.


### Continued development

At the moment I have completed the desktop version of this challenge. I will continue to work on the mobile version without the guidance of the YouTube video. Next challenge will include CSS flexbox & grid which I am very excited about. It was difficult without it.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Diner Game](https://flukeout.github.io/) - This game helped me understand all different levels of selectors. I would recommend this for anyone starting to learn them, but yet to grasp from just plain reading.
