        <h1> My First Webpage (HTML) </h1>
        <p> My name is Jennifer, and I'm starting my journey as a Front-end Developer from scratch </p>
        <p> I wanted to make sure I didn't skip any foundational knowledge that'll be important later on. It's been an exciting month of problem-solving in Codewars :) </p>
        <p> I want to continue building projects to showcase on an updated resume & portfolio </p>

        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelopezh/" target="_blank"> Here is my LinkedIn </a>,
        and here are a few things about me:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> I love playing rythm games such as Pump It Up and Rhythm Heaven </li>
            <li> I love crocheting cute Amigurumis. I do not sell nor take other people's fabric projects </li>
            <li> I graduated as a Software Engineer in May 2021 </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Here's a picture & video of one of my favorite Amigurumis I've made. </p>
